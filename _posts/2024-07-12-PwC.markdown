  ### Data Flow Architect  
  
  *Dec 2022 - Feb 2023*  
  *Data Architect*  

  - This project is about redesigning the cloud architecture of a hypermarket, and I'm on the Data team to help build the data architecture.

  - I was responsible for the data flows design. In short, I designed a process that allowed the client to clearly see the life of the data and to legally use the data collected from users in a compliant manner. This includes:
    - Data collection: data will be obtained from a variety of sources including user feedbacks, surveys, consumer records, supermarket records, warehouse inventory lists, etc.

    - Data pre-processing: data cleansing, data normalization, data screening to ensure high quality data. And in a unified form into the database

    - Data storage and use (the main part, including rights management, data modeling and other detailed specifications)

    - Compliance checking and monitoring of data (updating and deletion of data, in order to comply with GDPR and other policies).

    - Borrowing the concept of spotify's squad combined with the whole group in the center of excellence (COE), I help designed the client's Client data team employee structure with my team members.


  - I was very motivated to complete my first project successfully, and looking back, I think I'm still very satisfied. I was able to make a lot of changes to my work under the guidance of my manager, and in the end, both the manager and I were very happy with the results.
